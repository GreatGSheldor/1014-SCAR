SCAR - Surveillance, Control, Automation Robot
SCAR is a smart robot built with Arduino that can move, monitor the environment, and pick up objects. It uses sensors to detect gas and temperature, streams live video with a movable camera, and has a robotic arm for handling items.

Currently, SCAR is manually controlled via serial commands. Future updates will add wireless control and automation. The robot runs on battery power supported by a solar panel for longer use.

Perfect for safety monitoring, small deliveries, and remote assistance.
